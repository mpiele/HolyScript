# HOLY SCRIPT 

Holy script is an esoteric programming language designed for me, by me, to help me exercise my Python skills.

Pull requests are always welcome!

## INSTALL AND RUN

1. Clone this git repo with `git clone https://github.com/mpiele/HolyScript`
2. Run the `main.py` file using python3 and specify the text file which contains your code.

   (You have an example file, `sample_code.txt`)
   
   NOTE: Also specify the file extension, `.txt`, when running the program.

## HOW TO USE

### 1. PRINTING
To print to the console, use the `p` keyword and then write what you want to print between round brackets.

Example: `p (Hello, world!)`

### 2. COMMENTING
To add a comment in your code, use the `#` keyword and then write your comment after.

The program will print `COMMENT LINE`

Example: `# This is a comment`

### 3. ERRORS
If a line is not recognized, the program will print `NOT RECOGNIZED`

### NOTE: EVERY NEW LINE SHOULD BE ON A NEW ROW!
